# Malware

### Spyware
- provides remote access to data and sensors on your device
- keylogging, screen viewing, location tracking, camera access

### Adware
- malware that displays paid ads on your machine
- may change default browser or homepage
- may track browsing history for targeted ads

### Cryptojacking
- malware that runs crypto mining software in the backround of your computer
- not very valueable on a single machine, you need thousands of machines to make a reasonable amount of money
- can be injected through MITM as javascript run in a browser

### Ransomware
- encrypts the files on your device and demands payment to decrypt them
- relies on reputation of honesty of the specific ransomware because people will only pay the ransom if they believe they will actually get their files back

### DDoS
- many infected devices are used to simultaneously request data from a certain server, overloading it and making it inaccessible to other users

## Infection Methods

### Social Engineering

### Trojan Horse
- a malware app disguised as an app that has desired functionality
- fake antivirus software
- clones of popular apps, repackaged with malware

### Drive-by Downloads
- first uses client vulnerabilities to determine what system and software the client is using
- exploit kit will automatically deploy the correct exploit tailored to the client's software/system and install malware

### Supply Chain Attacks
- intercept hardware somewhere in the supply chain process
- carefully add/modify hardware so it can be exploited
- repackage the hardware and let it continue into the supply chain, eventually giving you a backdoor into networks or systems

### Hardware Trojans
- malicious change to circuits or chips 
- can be introduced during design, manufacturing, or distribution
- malicious code execution, disable security features, leak data over networks or radio, destroy device
- can be introduced through counterfeiting a chip, adding transistors, nicking the chip, chemical changes to the silicon dopant

## Self Replicating Malware

### Virus
- a virus spreads by modifying other programs to include copies of itself
- prepends its code to another programs executable, so it will be executed when the program runs
- can also infect document files
- antivirus software scans files for signatures of virus executables
- viruses can avoid signature detection by "mutating" their code by encrypting it or swapping out equivalent operations

### Worm
- similar to a virus, but it spreads through network vulnerabilities instead of local applications and files
- explands exponentially through a tree of network connections

## Malware Defenses
- secure programming with safe languages and practices
- security testing
- secure architectures
- runtime detection
- common sense

### Safe Browsing
  google safe browsing uses honeypot web crawlers to detect if webpages have malicious intentions, and give a warning when a user tries to access one of these sites
